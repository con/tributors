# CHANGELOG

This is a manually generated log to track changes to the repository for each release.
Each section should include general headers such as **Implemented enhancements**
and **Merged pull requests**. Critical items to know are:

 - renamed commands
 - deprecated / removed commands
 - changed defaults
 - backward incompatible changes
 - migration guidance
 - changed behaviour
