# Parsers

A parser is generally a service (API, command line tool, or similar) that helps
to generate some kind of metadata file to list your contributors. Tributors
currently supports several interfaces to common metadata formats:

 - [All-Contributors](allcontrib)
 - [Zenodo](zenodo)
 - [Codemeta](codemeta)


Would you like to see another metadata type? Please [open an issue])({{ site.repo }}/issues/new).
